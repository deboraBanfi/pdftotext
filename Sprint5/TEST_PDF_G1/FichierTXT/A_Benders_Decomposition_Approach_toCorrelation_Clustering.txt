 Abstract: 
We tackle the problem of graph partitioning for image segmentation using correlation clustering (CC), which we treat as an integer linear program (ILP). We
reformulate optimization in the ILP so as to admit efficient optimization via Benders decomposition, a classic technique from operations research. Our Benders
decomposition formulation has many subproblems, each associated with a node in
the CC instance’s graph, which can be solved in parallel. Each Benders subproblem
enforces the cycle inequalities corresponding to edges with negative (repulsive)
weights attached to its corresponding node in the CC instance. We generate
Magnanti-Wong Benders rows in addition to standard Benders rows to accelerate
optimization. Our Benders decomposition approach provides a promising new
avenue to accelerate optimization for CC, and, in contrast to previous cutting plane
approaches, theoretically allows for massive parallelization.

Introduction
Intro: 

Many computer vision tasks involve partitioning (clustering) a set of observations into unique entities.
A powerful formulation for such tasks is that of (weighted) correlation clustering (CC). CC is defined
on a sparse graph with real valued edge weights, where nodes correspond to observations and
weighted edges describe the affinity between pairs of nodes.
For example, in image segmentation (on superpixel graphs), nodes correspond to superpixels and
edges indicate adjacency between superpixels. The weight of the edge between a pair of superpixels
relates to the probability, as defined by a classifier, that the two superpixels belong to the same ground
truth entity. This weight is positive, if the probability is greater than 12 and negative if it is less than 12 .
The magnitude of the weight is a function of the confidence of the classifier.
The CC cost function sums up the weights of the edges separating connected components (referred
to as entities) in a proposed partitioning of the graph. Optimization in CC partitions the graph into
entities so as to minimize the CC cost. CC is appealing, since the optimal number of entities emerges
naturally as a function of the edge weights, rather than requiring an additional search over some
model order parameter describing the number of clusters (entities) [37].
Optimization in CC is NP-hard for general graphs [5]. Previous methods for the optimization of CC
problems such as described in Andres et al. [1, 2] and Nowozin and Jegelka [25] are based on linear
programming with cutting planes. They do not scale easily to large CC problem instances and are not
Preprint. Under review.

easily parallelizable. The goal of this paper is to introduce an efficient mechanism for optimization in
CC for domains, where massively parallel computation could be employed.
In this paper we apply the classic Benders decomposition from operations research [10] to CC for
computer vision. Benders decomposition is commonly applied in operations research to solve mixed
integer linear programs (MILP) that have a special but common block structure. Benders decomposition partitions the variables in the MILP between a master problem and a set of subproblems. The
block structure requires that no row of the constraint matrix of the MILP contains variables from
more than one subproblem. Variables explicitly enforced to be integral lie only in the master problem.
Optimization in Benders decomposition is achieved using a cutting plane algorithm. Optimization
proceeds with the master problem solving optimization over its variables. The subsequent solution
of the subproblems can be done in parallel and provides primal/dual solutions over their variables
conditioned on the solution to the master problem. The dual solutions to the subproblems provide
constraints to the master problem. Optimization continues until no further constraints are added to
the master problem.
Benders decomposition is an exact MILP programming solver, but can be intuitively understood as
a coordinate descent procedure, iterating between the master problem and the subproblems. Here,
solving the subproblems not only provides a solution for their variables, but also a lower bound in the
form of a hyper-plane over the master problem’s variables. This lower bound is tight at the current
solution to the master problem.
Benders decomposition is accelerated using the seminal operations research technique of MagnantiWong Benders rows (MWR) [23]. MWR are generated by solving the Benders subproblems with an
alternative (often random) objective under the hard constraint of optimality (possibly within a factor)
regarding the original objective of the subproblem.
Our contribution is the use of Benders decomposition with MWR to tackle optimization in CC. This
allows for massive parallelization, in contrast to classic approaches to CC such as in Andres et al. [1].

Related Work
Corps: 

Correlation clustering has been successfully applied to multiple problems in computer vision including
image segmentation, multi-object tracking, instance segmentation and multi-person pose estimation.
The classical work of Andres et al. [1] models image segmentation as CC, where nodes correspond to
superpixels. Andres et al. [1] optimize CC using an integer linear programming (ILP) branch-and-cut
strategy which precludes parallel execution. Kim et al. [21] extend CC to include higher-order cost
terms over sets of nodes, which they solve using an approach similar to [1]. A parallel optimization
scheme for complete, unweighted graphs has been proposed by Pan et al. [26]. This approach relies
on random sampling and only provides optimality bounds.
Yarkony et al. [37] tackle CC in the planar graph structured problems commonly found in computer
vision. They introduce a column generation [16, 6] approach, where the pricing problem corresponds
to finding the lowest reduced cost 2-colorable partition of the graph, via a reduction to minimum cost
perfect matching [13, 29, 22]. This approach has been extended to hierarchical image segmentation
in Yarkony and Fowlkes [35] and to specific cases of non-planar graphs in Yarkony [34], Zhang et al.
[39], Andres et al. [3].
Large CC problem instances such as defined in Keuper et al. [20, 19] and Beier et al. [9] are usually
addressed by primal feasible heuristics [7, 8, 18, 20, 30]. Such approaches are highly relevant in
practice whenever the optimal solution is out of reach, but they do not provide any guarantees on the
quality of the solution.
Tang et al. [31] tackles multi-object tracking using a formulation closely related to CC, where nodes
correspond to detections of objects and edges are associated with probabilities of co-association.The
work of Insafutdinov et al. [17] and Pishchulin et al. [27] build on Tang et al. [31] in order to formulate
multi-person pose estimation using CC augmented with node labeling.
Our work is derived from the classical work in operations research on Benders decomposition [10, 11,
15]. Specifically, we are inspired by the fixed charge formulations of Cordeau et al. [12], which solves
a mixed integer linear program over a set of fixed charge variables (opening links) and a larger set of
fractional variables (flows of commodities from facilities to customers in a network) associated with
2

constraints. Benders decomposition reformulates optimization so as to use only the integer variables
and converts the fractional variables into constraints. These constraints are referred to as Benders
rows. Optimization is then tackled using a cutting plane approach. Optimization is accelerated by the
use of MWR [23], which are more binding than the standard Benders rows.
Benders decomposition has recently been introduced to computer vision (though not for CC), for the
purpose of multi-person pose estimation [32, 33, 36]. In these works, multi-person pose estimation is
modeled so as to admit efficient optimization, using column generation and Benders decomposition
jointly. The application of Benders decomposition in our paper is distinct regarding the problem
domain, the underlying integer program and the structure of the Benders subproblems.

Standard Correlation Clustering Formulation

In this section, we review the standard optimization formulation for CC [1], which corresponds to a
graph partitioning problem w.r.t. the graph G = (V, E). This problem is defined by the following
binary edge labeling problem.
Definition 1. Given a graph G = (V, E) with nodes v ∈ V and undirected edges (vi , vj ) ∈ E. A
label xvi vj ∈ {0, 1} indicates with xvi vj = 1 that the nodes vi , vj are in separate components and is
zero otherwise. Given the edge weight φvi vj ∈ R, the binary edge labeling problem is to find an edge
label x = (xvi vj ) ∈ {0, 1}|E| , for which the total weight of the cut edges is minimized:
min

x∈{0,1}|E|

s.t.

xvi vj ≥ xvic vjc

∀c ∈ C,

(1)

(vi ,vj )∈Ec+

where E − , E + denote the subsets of E, for which the weight φvi vj is negative and non-negative,
respectively, C is the set of undirected cycles in E containing exactly one member of E − , (vic , vjc ) is
the edge in E − associated with cycle c and Ec+ ⊆ E + associated with cycle c.
Note that the graph G defined by E is very sparse for real problems [37]. Also we refer to an edge
(vi , vj ) with xvi vj = 1 as a cut edge.
The objective in Eq. (CC1 ) is to minimize the total weight of the cut edges. The constraints in Eq. (1)
ensure that, within every cycle of G, the number of cut edges can not be exactly one. This enforces
the labeling x to decompose G such that cut edges are exactly those edges that straddle distinct
components. We refer to the constraints in Eq. (1) as cycle inequalities.
Solving Eq. (CC1 ) is intractable due to the large number of cycle inequalities. Andres et al. [1]
generates solutions by alternating between solving the ILP over a nascent set of constraints Cˆ
(initialized empty) and adding new constraints from the set of currently violated cycle inequalities.
Generating constraints corresponds to iterating over (vi , vj ) ∈ E − and identifying the shortest
path between the nodes vi , vj in the graph with edges E \ (vi , vj ) and weights equal to x. If the
ˆ The
corresponding path has total weight less than xvi vj , the corresponding constraint is added to C.
LP relaxation of Eq. (CC1 )-(1) can be solved instead of the ILP in each iteration until no violated
cycle inequalities exist, after which the ILP must be solved in each iteration.
We should note that earlier work in CC for computer vision did not require that cycle inequalities
contain exactly one member of E − , which is on the right hand side of Eq. (1). It is established with
Lemma(1) in Yarkony et al. [38], that the addition of cycle inequalities, that contain edges in E − , E +
on the left hand side, right hand side of Eq. (1), respectively, do not tighten the ILP in Eq. (CC1 )-(1)
or its LP relaxation.
In this section, we reviewed the baseline approach for solving CC in the computer vision community.
In the subsequent sections, we rely on the characterization of CC in Eq. (CC1 )-(1), though not on the
specific solver of Andres et al. [1].

Benders Decomposition for Correlation Clustering

In this section, we introduce a novel approach to CC using Benders decomposition (referred to as
BDCC). Our proposed decomposition is defined by a minimal vertex cover on E − with members
S ⊂ V indexed by vs . Each s ∈ S is associated with a Benders subproblem and vs is referred to as
the root of that Benders subproblem. Edges in E − are partitioned arbitrarily between the subproblems,
such that each (vi , vj ) ∈ E − is associated with either the subproblem with root vi or the subproblem
with root vj . Here, Es− is the subset of E − associated with subproblem s. The subproblem with root
vs enforces the cycle inequalities Cs , where Cs is the subset of C containing edges in Es− . We use Es+
to denote the subset of E + adjacent to vs .
In this section, we assume that we are provided with S, which can be produced greedily or using an
LP/ILP solver.
Below, we rewrite Eq. (CC1 ) using an auxiliary function Q(φ, s, x). Here Q(φ, s, x) provides the
cost to alter x to satisfy all cycle inequalities in Cs , by increasing/decreasing xvi vj for (vi , vj ) in
E + /Es− , respectively. Below we describe the changes of the master’s problem edge labeling x, which
is based on the edge labeling of each Benders subproblem xs = (xsvi vj ) ∈ {0, 1}|s| , where |s| is the
number of edges in the subproblem s.

We now construct a solution x∗ = {x∗vi vj , (xs∗
vi vj )s∈S } for which Eq. (CC2 ) is minimized and all
cycle inequalities are satisfied. We start from a given solution x = {xvi vj , (xsvi vj )s∈S } and proceed
as follows.

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E + .

(4)

The right hand side of Eq. (4) cannot exceed 1 at optimality because of the constraint in Eq. (2).
Given the solution x∗vi vj , the optimizing solution to each Benders subproblem s is denoted xs∗
vi vj and
is defined as follows.

1, if (vi , vj ) ∈ Es−
xs∗
=
(5)
vi vj
0, otherwise.
In Sec. A in the supplement, we show that the cost of {x∗vi vj , (xs∗
vi vj )s∈S } is no greater than that of
{xvi vj , (xsvi vj )s∈S }, with regard to the objective in Eq. (CC2 ) and that Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0 holds for all
s ∈ S.
It follows that there always exists an optimizing solution x to Eq. (CC2 ) such that Q(φ, s, x) = 0 for
all s ∈ S.
Observe, that there exists an optimal partition xs of the nodes of the graph , in Eq. (2), which is
2-colorable. This is because any partition xs can be altered without increasing its cost, by merging
connected components that are adjacent to one another, not including the root node vs . Note, that
merging any pair of such components, does not increase the cost, since those components are not
separated by negative weight edges in subproblem s and so the result is still a partition.
Given this observation, we rewrite the optimization Eq. (CC2 ) regarding Q(φ, s, x), using the node
labeling formulation of min-cut, with the notation below.
4

We indicate with mv = 1 that node v ∈ V is not in the component associated with the root of
subproblem s and mv = 0 otherwise. To avoid extra notation mvs is replaced by 0. Let
(
1, for (vi , vj ) ∈ E + , if (vi , vj ) is cut in xs , but is not cut in x
s
f vi vj =
(6)
1, for (vi , vj ) ∈ Es− , if (vi , vj ) is not cut in xs , but is cut in x.
Thus, the definition for the first/second case implies a penalty of φvi vj / - φvi vj , which is added to
Q(φ, s, x). Note moreover that xsvi vj = fvsi vj for all (vi , vj ) ∈ E + and that xsvi vj = 1 − fvsi vj for all
(vi , vj ) ∈ Es− .
Below we write Q(φ, s, x) as primal/dual LP, with primal constraints associated with dual variables
ψ, λ, which are noted in the primal. Given binary x, we need only enforce that f, m are non-negative
to ensure that there exists an optimizing solution for f, m which is binary. This is a consequence of
the optimization being totally unimodular, given that x is binary. Total unimodularity is a known
property of the min-cut/max flow LP [14]. The primal subproblem is therefore given by the following.

In Eq. (8) and subsequently 1Λ (x) denotes the binary indicator function for some set Λ, which returns
one if (x ∈ Λ) and zero otherwise. We now consider the constraint that Q(φ, s, x) = 0. Note that
any dual feasible solution for the dual problem (8) describes an affine function of x, which is a tight
lower bound on Q(φ, s, x). We compact the terms λ, ψ into ω z , where ωvzi vj is associated with the

Cutting Plane Optimization

Optimization in Eq. (CC3 ) is intractable since |Z| equals the number of dual feasible solutions across
subproblems, which is infinite. Since we cannot consider the entire set Z, we use a cutting plane
approach to construct a set Ẑ ⊂ Z, that is sufficient to solve Eq. (CC3 ) exactly. We initialize Ẑ as
the empty set. We iterate between solving the LP relaxation of Eq. (CC3 ) over Ẑ (referred to as the
master problem) and generating new Benders rows until no violated constraints exist.
This ensures that no violated cycle inequalities exist but may not ensure that x is integral. To enforce
integrality, we iterate between solving the ILP in Eq. (CC3 ) over Ẑ and adding Benders rows to Ẑ.
By solving the LP relaxation first, we avoid unnecessary and expensive calls to the ILP solver.
To generate Benders rows given x, we iterate over S and generate one Benders row using Eq. (8), if s
is associated with a violated cycle inequality, which we determine as follows. Given s, x we iterate
over (vi , vj ) ∈ Es− . We find the shortest path from vi to vj on graph G with edges E, with weights
equal to the vector x. If the length of this path, denoted as d(vi , vj ), is strictly less than xvi vj , then
we have identified a violated cycle inequality associated with s.
We describe our cutting plane approach in Alg. 1, with line by line description in Sec. B in the
supplementary material. To accelerate optimization, we add MWR in addition to standard Benders
rows, which we describe in the following Sec. 5.
Prior to termination of Alg. 1, one can produce a feasible integer solution x∗ from any solution x,
1
provided by the master problem, as follows. First, for each (vi , vj ) ∈ E, set x∗∗
vi vj = 1, if xvi vj > 2
∗
and otherwise set x∗∗
vi vj = 0. Second, for each (vi , vj ) ∈ E, set xvi vj = 1, if vi , vj are in separate
∗∗
connected components of the solution described by x and otherwise set x∗vi vj = 0. The cost of the
feasible integer solution x∗ provides an upper bound on the cost of the optimal solution. In Sec. C
(supplementary material), we provide a more involved approach to produce feasible integer solutions.
In this section, we characterized CC using Benders decomposition and provided a cutting plane
algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization.

Magnanti-Wong Benders Rows

We accelerate Benders decomposition (see Sec. 4) using the classic operations research technique of
Magnanti-Wong Benders Rows (MWR) [23]. The Benders row, given in Eq. (8), provides a tight
bound at x∗ , where x∗ is the master problem solution used to generate the Benders row. However,
ideally, we want our Benders row to provide good lower bounds for a large set of x different from x∗ ,
6

Figure 1: Left: We plot the gap between the upper and lower bounds as a function of time for various
values of τ on selected problem instances. We use red,green,blue for τ = [0.5, 0.99, .01] respectively,
and black for not using Magnanti-Wong rows. We show both the computation time with and without
exploiting parallelization of subproblems with dotted and solid lines, respectively. We use titles to
indicate the approximate difficulty of the problem as ranked by input file size of 100 files.
Right: We compare the benefits of parallelization and MWR across our data set. We scatter plot the
total running time versus the total running time when solving each subproblem is done on its own
CPU across problem instances. We use red to indicate τ = 0.5 and black to indicate that MWR are
not used. We draw a line with slope=1 in magenta to better enable appreciation of the red and black
points. NOTE: The time spent generating Benders rows, in a given iteration of BDCC when using
parallel processing, is the maximum time spent to solve any sub-problem for that iteration.
while being tight (or perhaps very active) at x∗ . To achieve this, we use a modified version of Eq. (8),
where we replace the objective and add one additional constraint.
We follow the tradition of the operations research literature and use a random negative valued vector
(with unit norm) in place of the objective Eq. (8). This random vector is unique each time a Benders
−1
subproblem is solved. We experimented with using as an objective .0001+|φ
, which encourages
vi vj |
the cutting of edges with large positive weight, but it works as well as the random negative objective.
Here .0001 is a tiny positive number. It prevents the terms in the objective from becoming infinite.
Below, we enforce the new Benders row to be active at x∗ , by requiring that the dual cost is within a
tolerance τ ∈ (0, 1) of the optimum w.r.t. the objective in Eq. (8).

Experiments: Image Segmentation

In this section, we demonstrate the value of our algorithm BDCC on CC problem instances for image
segmentation on the benchmark Berkeley Segmentation Data Set (BSDS) [24]. Our experiments
demonstrate the following three findings. (1) BDCC solves CC instances for image segmentation; (2) BDCC successfully exploits parallelization; (3) the use of MWR dramatically accelerates
optimization.
To benchmark performance, we employ cost terms provided by the OPENGM2 dataset [4] for BSDS.
This allows for a direct comparison of our results to the ones from Andres et al. [1]. We use the
random unit norm negative valued objective when generating MWR. We use CPLEX to solve all
linear and integer linear programming problems considered during the course of optimization. We use
a maximum total CPU time of 600 seconds, for each problem instance (regardless of parallelization).

We formulate the selection of S, as a minimum vertex cover problem, where for every edge (vi , vj ) ∈
E − , at least one of vi , vj is in S. We solve for the minimum vertex cover exactly as an ILP. Given S,
we assign edges in E − to a connected selected node in S arbitrarily. We found experimentally that
solving for the minimum vertex cover consumed negligible CPU time for our dataset. We attribute
this fact to the structure of our problem domain, since the minimum vertex cover is an NP-hard
problem. For problem instances where solving for the minimum vertex cover exactly is difficult, the
minimum vertex cover problem can be solved approximately or greedily.
In Fig. 1 (left) we demonstrate the effectiveness of BDCC with various τ for different problem
difficulties. We observe that the presence of MWR dramatically accelerates optimization. However,
the exact value of τ does not effect the speed of optimization dramatically. We show performance
with and without relying on parallel processing. Our parallel processing times assume that we
have one CPU for each subproblem. For the problem instances in our application the number of
subproblems is under one thousand, each of which are very easy to solve. The parallel and nonparallel time comparisons share only the time to solve the master problem. We observe large benefits
of parallelization for all settings of τ . However, when MWR are not used, we observe diminished
improvement, since the master problem consumes a larger proportion of total CPU time.
In Fig. 1(right), we demonstrate the speed up induced by the use of parallelization. For most problem
instances, the total CPU time required when using no MWR was prohibitively large, which is not the
case when MWR are employed. Thus most problem instances solved without MWR terminated early.
In Tab. 1, we consider the convergence of the bounds for τ = {0, 12 }; ( τ = 0 means that no MWR
are generated). We consider a set of tolerances on convergence regarding the duality gap, which is
the difference between the anytime solution (upper bound) and the lower bound on the objective. For
each such tolerance , we compute the percentage of instances, for which the duality gap is less than
, after various amounts of time. We observe that the performance of optimization without MWR,
but exploiting parallelization performs worse than using MWR, but without paralleliziation. This
demonstrates that, across the dataset, MWR are of greater importance than parallelization.

Abstract
We tackle the problem of graph partitioning for image segmentation using correlation clustering (CC), which we treat as an integer linear program (ILP). We
reformulate optimization in the ILP so as to admit efficient optimization via Benders decomposition, a classic technique from operations research. Our Benders
decomposition formulation has many subproblems, each associated with a node in
the CC instance’s graph, which can be solved in parallel. Each Benders subproblem
enforces the cycle inequalities corresponding to edges with negative (repulsive)
weights attached to its corresponding node in the CC instance. We generate
Magnanti-Wong Benders rows in addition to standard Benders rows to accelerate
optimization. Our Benders decomposition approach provides a promising new
avenue to accelerate optimization for CC, and, in contrast to previous cutting plane
approaches, theoretically allows for massive parallelization.

Introduction

Many computer vision tasks involve partitioning (clustering) a set of observations into unique entities.
A powerful formulation for such tasks is that of (weighted) correlation clustering (CC). CC is defined
on a sparse graph with real valued edge weights, where nodes correspond to observations and
weighted edges describe the affinity between pairs of nodes.
For example, in image segmentation (on superpixel graphs), nodes correspond to superpixels and
edges indicate adjacency between superpixels. The weight of the edge between a pair of superpixels
relates to the probability, as defined by a classifier, that the two superpixels belong to the same ground
truth entity. This weight is positive, if the probability is greater than 12 and negative if it is less than 12 .
The magnitude of the weight is a function of the confidence of the classifier.
The CC cost function sums up the weights of the edges separating connected components (referred
to as entities) in a proposed partitioning of the graph. Optimization in CC partitions the graph into
entities so as to minimize the CC cost. CC is appealing, since the optimal number of entities emerges
naturally as a function of the edge weights, rather than requiring an additional search over some
model order parameter describing the number of clusters (entities) [37].
Optimization in CC is NP-hard for general graphs [5]. Previous methods for the optimization of CC
problems such as described in Andres et al. [1, 2] and Nowozin and Jegelka [25] are based on linear
programming with cutting planes. They do not scale easily to large CC problem instances and are not
Preprint. Under review.

easily parallelizable. The goal of this paper is to introduce an efficient mechanism for optimization in
CC for domains, where massively parallel computation could be employed.
In this paper we apply the classic Benders decomposition from operations research [10] to CC for
computer vision. Benders decomposition is commonly applied in operations research to solve mixed
integer linear programs (MILP) that have a special but common block structure. Benders decomposition partitions the variables in the MILP between a master problem and a set of subproblems. The
block structure requires that no row of the constraint matrix of the MILP contains variables from
more than one subproblem. Variables explicitly enforced to be integral lie only in the master problem.
Optimization in Benders decomposition is achieved using a cutting plane algorithm. Optimization
proceeds with the master problem solving optimization over its variables. The subsequent solution
of the subproblems can be done in parallel and provides primal/dual solutions over their variables
conditioned on the solution to the master problem. The dual solutions to the subproblems provide
constraints to the master problem. Optimization continues until no further constraints are added to
the master problem.
Benders decomposition is an exact MILP programming solver, but can be intuitively understood as
a coordinate descent procedure, iterating between the master problem and the subproblems. Here,
solving the subproblems not only provides a solution for their variables, but also a lower bound in the
form of a hyper-plane over the master problem’s variables. This lower bound is tight at the current
solution to the master problem.
Benders decomposition is accelerated using the seminal operations research technique of MagnantiWong Benders rows (MWR) [23]. MWR are generated by solving the Benders subproblems with an
alternative (often random) objective under the hard constraint of optimality (possibly within a factor)
regarding the original objective of the subproblem.
Our contribution is the use of Benders decomposition with MWR to tackle optimization in CC. This
allows for massive parallelization, in contrast to classic approaches to CC such as in Andres et al. [1].

Related Work

Correlation clustering has been successfully applied to multiple problems in computer vision including
image segmentation, multi-object tracking, instance segmentation and multi-person pose estimation.
The classical work of Andres et al. [1] models image segmentation as CC, where nodes correspond to
superpixels. Andres et al. [1] optimize CC using an integer linear programming (ILP) branch-and-cut
strategy which precludes parallel execution. Kim et al. [21] extend CC to include higher-order cost
terms over sets of nodes, which they solve using an approach similar to [1]. A parallel optimization
scheme for complete, unweighted graphs has been proposed by Pan et al. [26]. This approach relies
on random sampling and only provides optimality bounds.
Yarkony et al. [37] tackle CC in the planar graph structured problems commonly found in computer
vision. They introduce a column generation [16, 6] approach, where the pricing problem corresponds
to finding the lowest reduced cost 2-colorable partition of the graph, via a reduction to minimum cost
perfect matching [13, 29, 22]. This approach has been extended to hierarchical image segmentation
in Yarkony and Fowlkes [35] and to specific cases of non-planar graphs in Yarkony [34], Zhang et al.
[39], Andres et al. [3].
Large CC problem instances such as defined in Keuper et al. [20, 19] and Beier et al. [9] are usually
addressed by primal feasible heuristics [7, 8, 18, 20, 30]. Such approaches are highly relevant in
practice whenever the optimal solution is out of reach, but they do not provide any guarantees on the
quality of the solution.
Tang et al. [31] tackles multi-object tracking using a formulation closely related to CC, where nodes
correspond to detections of objects and edges are associated with probabilities of co-association.The
work of Insafutdinov et al. [17] and Pishchulin et al. [27] build on Tang et al. [31] in order to formulate
multi-person pose estimation using CC augmented with node labeling.
Our work is derived from the classical work in operations research on Benders decomposition [10, 11,
15]. Specifically, we are inspired by the fixed charge formulations of Cordeau et al. [12], which solves
a mixed integer linear program over a set of fixed charge variables (opening links) and a larger set of
fractional variables (flows of commodities from facilities to customers in a network) associated with
2

constraints. Benders decomposition reformulates optimization so as to use only the integer variables
and converts the fractional variables into constraints. These constraints are referred to as Benders
rows. Optimization is then tackled using a cutting plane approach. Optimization is accelerated by the
use of MWR [23], which are more binding than the standard Benders rows.
Benders decomposition has recently been introduced to computer vision (though not for CC), for the
purpose of multi-person pose estimation [32, 33, 36]. In these works, multi-person pose estimation is
modeled so as to admit efficient optimization, using column generation and Benders decomposition
jointly. The application of Benders decomposition in our paper is distinct regarding the problem
domain, the underlying integer program and the structure of the Benders subproblems.

Standard Correlation Clustering Formulation

In this section, we review the standard optimization formulation for CC [1], which corresponds to a
graph partitioning problem w.r.t. the graph G = (V, E). This problem is defined by the following
binary edge labeling problem.
Definition 1. Given a graph G = (V, E) with nodes v ∈ V and undirected edges (vi , vj ) ∈ E. A
label xvi vj ∈ {0, 1} indicates with xvi vj = 1 that the nodes vi , vj are in separate components and is
zero otherwise. Given the edge weight φvi vj ∈ R, the binary edge labeling problem is to find an edge
label x = (xvi vj ) ∈ {0, 1}|E| , for which the total weight of the cut edges is minimized:
min

x∈{0,1}|E|

s.t.

(vi ,vj )∈E +

xvi vj ≥ xvic vjc

∀c ∈ C,

(1)

(vi ,vj )∈Ec+

where E − , E + denote the subsets of E, for which the weight φvi vj is negative and non-negative,
respectively, C is the set of undirected cycles in E containing exactly one member of E − , (vic , vjc ) is
the edge in E − associated with cycle c and Ec+ ⊆ E + associated with cycle c.
Note that the graph G defined by E is very sparse for real problems [37]. Also we refer to an edge
(vi , vj ) with xvi vj = 1 as a cut edge.
The objective in Eq. (CC1 ) is to minimize the total weight of the cut edges. The constraints in Eq. (1)
ensure that, within every cycle of G, the number of cut edges can not be exactly one. This enforces
the labeling x to decompose G such that cut edges are exactly those edges that straddle distinct
components. We refer to the constraints in Eq. (1) as cycle inequalities.
Solving Eq. (CC1 ) is intractable due to the large number of cycle inequalities. Andres et al. [1]
generates solutions by alternating between solving the ILP over a nascent set of constraints Cˆ
(initialized empty) and adding new constraints from the set of currently violated cycle inequalities.
Generating constraints corresponds to iterating over (vi , vj ) ∈ E − and identifying the shortest
path between the nodes vi , vj in the graph with edges E \ (vi , vj ) and weights equal to x. If the
ˆ The
corresponding path has total weight less than xvi vj , the corresponding constraint is added to C.
LP relaxation of Eq. (CC1 )-(1) can be solved instead of the ILP in each iteration until no violated
cycle inequalities exist, after which the ILP must be solved in each iteration.
We should note that earlier work in CC for computer vision did not require that cycle inequalities
contain exactly one member of E − , which is on the right hand side of Eq. (1). It is established with
Lemma(1) in Yarkony et al. [38], that the addition of cycle inequalities, that contain edges in E − , E +
on the left hand side, right hand side of Eq. (1), respectively, do not tighten the ILP in Eq. (CC1 )-(1)
or its LP relaxation.
In this section, we reviewed the baseline approach for solving CC in the computer vision community.
In the subsequent sections, we rely on the characterization of CC in Eq. (CC1 )-(1), though not on the
specific solver of Andres et al. [1].

Benders Decomposition for Correlation Clustering

In this section, we introduce a novel approach to CC using Benders decomposition (referred to as
BDCC). Our proposed decomposition is defined by a minimal vertex cover on E − with members
S ⊂ V indexed by vs . Each s ∈ S is associated with a Benders subproblem and vs is referred to as
the root of that Benders subproblem. Edges in E − are partitioned arbitrarily between the subproblems,
such that each (vi , vj ) ∈ E − is associated with either the subproblem with root vi or the subproblem
with root vj . Here, Es− is the subset of E − associated with subproblem s. The subproblem with root
vs enforces the cycle inequalities Cs , where Cs is the subset of C containing edges in Es− . We use Es+
to denote the subset of E + adjacent to vs .
In this section, we assume that we are provided with S, which can be produced greedily or using an
LP/ILP solver.
Below, we rewrite Eq. (CC1 ) using an auxiliary function Q(φ, s, x). Here Q(φ, s, x) provides the
cost to alter x to satisfy all cycle inequalities in Cs , by increasing/decreasing xvi vj for (vi , vj ) in
E + /Es− , respectively. Below we describe the changes of the master’s problem edge labeling x, which
is based on the edge labeling of each Benders subproblem xs = (xsvi vj ) ∈ {0, 1}|s| , where |s| is the
number of edges in the subproblem s.

We now construct a solution x∗ = {x∗vi vj , (xs∗
vi vj )s∈S } for which Eq. (CC2 ) is minimized and all
cycle inequalities are satisfied. We start from a given solution x = {xvi vj , (xsvi vj )s∈S } and proceed
as follows.

x∗vi vj = min(xvi vj , xsvi vj ) ∀(vi , vj ) ∈ Es− , s ∈ S
M

x∗vi vj = xvi vj + max xsvi vj

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E + .

(3)
(4)

The right hand side of Eq. (4) cannot exceed 1 at optimality because of the constraint in Eq. (2).
Given the solution x∗vi vj , the optimizing solution to each Benders subproblem s is denoted xs∗
vi vj and
is defined as follows.

1, if (vi , vj ) ∈ Es−
xs∗
=
(5)
vi vj
0, otherwise.
In Sec. A in the supplement, we show that the cost of {x∗vi vj , (xs∗
vi vj )s∈S } is no greater than that of
{xvi vj , (xsvi vj )s∈S }, with regard to the objective in Eq. (CC2 ) and that Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0 holds for all
s ∈ S.
It follows that there always exists an optimizing solution x to Eq. (CC2 ) such that Q(φ, s, x) = 0 for
all s ∈ S.
Observe, that there exists an optimal partition xs of the nodes of the graph , in Eq. (2), which is
2-colorable. This is because any partition xs can be altered without increasing its cost, by merging
connected components that are adjacent to one another, not including the root node vs . Note, that
merging any pair of such components, does not increase the cost, since those components are not
separated by negative weight edges in subproblem s and so the result is still a partition.
Given this observation, we rewrite the optimization Eq. (CC2 ) regarding Q(φ, s, x), using the node
labeling formulation of min-cut, with the notation below.
4

We indicate with mv = 1 that node v ∈ V is not in the component associated with the root of
subproblem s and mv = 0 otherwise. To avoid extra notation mvs is replaced by 0. Let
(
1, for (vi , vj ) ∈ E + , if (vi , vj ) is cut in xs , but is not cut in x
s
f vi vj =
(6)
1, for (vi , vj ) ∈ Es− , if (vi , vj ) is not cut in xs , but is cut in x.
Thus, the definition for the first/second case implies a penalty of φvi vj / - φvi vj , which is added to
Q(φ, s, x). Note moreover that xsvi vj = fvsi vj for all (vi , vj ) ∈ E + and that xsvi vj = 1 − fvsi vj for all
(vi , vj ) ∈ Es− .
Below we write Q(φ, s, x) as primal/dual LP, with primal constraints associated with dual variables
ψ, λ, which are noted in the primal. Given binary x, we need only enforce that f, m are non-negative
to ensure that there exists an optimizing solution for f, m which is binary. This is a consequence of
the optimization being totally unimodular, given that x is binary. Total unimodularity is a known
property of the min-cut/max flow LP [14]. The primal subproblem is therefore given by the following.

In Eq. (8) and subsequently 1Λ (x) denotes the binary indicator function for some set Λ, which returns

lower bound on Q(φ, s, x). We compact the terms λ, ψ into ω z , where ωvzi vj is associated with the

Cutting Plane Optimization

Optimization in Eq. (CC3 ) is intractable since |Z| equals the number of dual feasible solutions across
subproblems, which is infinite. Since we cannot consider the entire set Z, we use a cutting plane
approach to construct a set Ẑ ⊂ Z, that is sufficient to solve Eq. (CC3 ) exactly. We initialize Ẑ as
the empty set. We iterate between solving the LP relaxation of Eq. (CC3 ) over Ẑ (referred to as the
master problem) and generating new Benders rows until no violated constraints exist.
This ensures that no violated cycle inequalities exist but may not ensure that x is integral. To enforce
integrality, we iterate between solving the ILP in Eq. (CC3 ) over Ẑ and adding Benders rows to Ẑ.
By solving the LP relaxation first, we avoid unnecessary and expensive calls to the ILP solver.
To generate Benders rows given x, we iterate over S and generate one Benders row using Eq. (8), if s
is associated with a violated cycle inequality, which we determine as follows. Given s, x we iterate
over (vi , vj ) ∈ Es− . We find the shortest path from vi to vj on graph G with edges E, with weights
equal to the vector x. If the length of this path, denoted as d(vi , vj ), is strictly less than xvi vj , then
we have identified a violated cycle inequality associated with s.
We describe our cutting plane approach in Alg. 1, with line by line description in Sec. B in the
supplementary material. To accelerate optimization, we add MWR in addition to standard Benders
rows, which we describe in the following Sec. 5.
Prior to termination of Alg. 1, one can produce a feasible integer solution x∗ from any solution x,
1
provided by the master problem, as follows. First, for each (vi , vj ) ∈ E, set x∗∗
vi vj = 1, if xvi vj > 2
∗
and otherwise set x∗∗
vi vj = 0. Second, for each (vi , vj ) ∈ E, set xvi vj = 1, if vi , vj are in separate
∗∗
connected components of the solution described by x and otherwise set x∗vi vj = 0. The cost of the
feasible integer solution x∗ provides an upper bound on the cost of the optimal solution. In Sec. C
(supplementary material), we provide a more involved approach to produce feasible integer solutions.
In this section, we characterized CC using Benders decomposition and provided a cutting plane
algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization.

Magnanti-Wong Benders Rows

We accelerate Benders decomposition (see Sec. 4) using the classic operations research technique of
Magnanti-Wong Benders Rows (MWR) [23]. The Benders row, given in Eq. (8), provides a tight
bound at x∗ , where x∗ is the master problem solution used to generate the Benders row. However,
ideally, we want our Benders row to provide good lower bounds for a large set of x different from x∗ ,
6

Figure 1: Left: We plot the gap between the upper and lower bounds as a function of time for various
values of τ on selected problem instances. We use red,green,blue for τ = [0.5, 0.99, .01] respectively,
and black for not using Magnanti-Wong rows. We show both the computation time with and without
exploiting parallelization of subproblems with dotted and solid lines, respectively. We use titles to
indicate the approximate difficulty of the problem as ranked by input file size of 100 files.
Right: We compare the benefits of parallelization and MWR across our data set. We scatter plot the
total running time versus the total running time when solving each subproblem is done on its own
CPU across problem instances. We use red to indicate τ = 0.5 and black to indicate that MWR are
not used. We draw a line with slope=1 in magenta to better enable appreciation of the red and black
points. NOTE: The time spent generating Benders rows, in a given iteration of BDCC when using
parallel processing, is the maximum time spent to solve any sub-problem for that iteration.
while being tight (or perhaps very active) at x∗ . To achieve this, we use a modified version of Eq. (8),
where we replace the objective and add one additional constraint.
We follow the tradition of the operations research literature and use a random negative valued vector
(with unit norm) in place of the objective Eq. (8). This random vector is unique each time a Benders
−1
subproblem is solved. We experimented with using as an objective .0001+|φ
, which encourages
vi vj |
the cutting of edges with large positive weight, but it works as well as the random negative objective.
Here .0001 is a tiny positive number. It prevents the terms in the objective from becoming infinite.
Below, we enforce the new Benders row to be active at x∗ , by requiring that the dual cost is within a
tolerance τ ∈ (0, 1) of the optimum w.r.t. the objective in Eq. (8).

Experiments: Image Segmentation

In this section, we demonstrate the value of our algorithm BDCC on CC problem instances for image
segmentation on the benchmark Berkeley Segmentation Data Set (BSDS) [24]. Our experiments
demonstrate the following three findings. (1) BDCC solves CC instances for image segmentation; (2) BDCC successfully exploits parallelization; (3) the use of MWR dramatically accelerates
optimization.
To benchmark performance, we employ cost terms provided by the OPENGM2 dataset [4] for BSDS.
This allows for a direct comparison of our results to the ones from Andres et al. [1]. We use the
random unit norm negative valued objective when generating MWR. We use CPLEX to solve all
linear and integer linear programming problems considered during the course of optimization. We use
a maximum total CPU time of 600 seconds, for each problem instance (regardless of parallelization).

We formulate the selection of S, as a minimum vertex cover problem, where for every edge (vi , vj ) ∈
E − , at least one of vi , vj is in S. We solve for the minimum vertex cover exactly as an ILP. Given S,
we assign edges in E − to a connected selected node in S arbitrarily. We found experimentally that
solving for the minimum vertex cover consumed negligible CPU time for our dataset. We attribute
this fact to the structure of our problem domain, since the minimum vertex cover is an NP-hard
problem. For problem instances where solving for the minimum vertex cover exactly is difficult, the
minimum vertex cover problem can be solved approximately or greedily.
In Fig. 1 (left) we demonstrate the effectiveness of BDCC with various τ for different problem
difficulties. We observe that the presence of MWR dramatically accelerates optimization. However,
the exact value of τ does not effect the speed of optimization dramatically. We show performance
with and without relying on parallel processing. Our parallel processing times assume that we
have one CPU for each subproblem. For the problem instances in our application the number of
subproblems is under one thousand, each of which are very easy to solve. The parallel and nonparallel time comparisons share only the time to solve the master problem. We observe large benefits
of parallelization for all settings of τ . However, when MWR are not used, we observe diminished
improvement, since the master problem consumes a larger proportion of total CPU time.
In Fig. 1(right), we demonstrate the speed up induced by the use of parallelization. For most problem
instances, the total CPU time required when using no MWR was prohibitively large, which is not the
case when MWR are employed. Thus most problem instances solved without MWR terminated early.
In Tab. 1, we consider the convergence of the bounds for τ = {0, 12 }; ( τ = 0 means that no MWR
are generated). We consider a set of tolerances on convergence regarding the duality gap, which is
the difference between the anytime solution (upper bound) and the lower bound on the objective. For
each such tolerance , we compute the percentage of instances, for which the duality gap is less than
, after various amounts of time. We observe that the performance of optimization without MWR,
but exploiting parallelization performs worse than using MWR, but without paralleliziation. This
demonstrates that, across the dataset, MWR are of greater importance than parallelization.

Conclusions

We present a novel methodology for finding optimal correlation clustering in arbitrary graphs. Our
method exploits the Benders decomposition to avoid the enumeration of a large number of cycle
inequalities. This offers a new technique in the toolkit of linear programming relaxations, that we
expect will find further use in the application of combinatorial optimization to problems in computer
vision.

The exploitation of results from the domain of operations research may lead to improved variants
of BDCC. For example, one can intelligently select the subproblems to solve instead of solving all
subproblems in each iteration. This strategy is referred to as partial pricing in the operations research
literature. Similarly one can devote a minimum amount of time in each iteration to solve the master
problem so as to enforce integrality on a subset of the variables of the master problem.

APPENDIX: Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0 at Optimality

In this section, we demonstrate that there exists an x∗ , that minimizes Eq. (CC2 ), for which Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0.
Given an arbitrary solution {xvi vj , (xsvi vj )s∈S } another solution {x∗vi vj , (xs∗
vi vj )s∈S } is constructed, for which
Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0 holds, without increasing the objective in Eq. (CC2 ). We write the updates below in terms of
xs .
M

x∗vi vj = xvi vj + max xsvi vj
s∈S

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E +

M

x∗vi vj = xvi vj + xsvi vj − 1 ∀(vi , vj ) ∈ Es− , s ∈ S
M

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E +

M

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ Es− , s ∈ S.

vi vj = 0
xs∗
vi vj = 1

(10)

The updates in Eq. (10) are equivalent to the following updates using f s ,f s∗ . Here f s , f s∗ correspond to the
optimizing solution for f in subproblem s, given x, x∗ respectively.
x∗vi vj = xvi vj + max fvsi vj
s∈S

x∗vi vj = xvi vj − fvsi vj

fvs∗
= 0 ∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E +
i vj

(11)

fvs∗
= 0 ∀(vi , vj ) ∈ Es−
i vj
These updates in Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) preserve the feasibility of the primal LP in Eq. (7). Also notice, that
since f s∗ is a zero valued vector for all s ∈ S, then Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0 for all s ∈ S.
We now consider, the total change in Eq. (CC2 ) corresponding to edge (vi , vj ) ∈ E + , induced by Eq. (10),
which is non-positive. The objective of the master problem increases by φvi vj maxs∈S xsvi vj , while the total
P
decrease in the objectives of the subproblems is φvi vj s∈S xsvi vj . Since the latter value is greater than the
former value, the total change in problem (CC2 ) decreases more than it increases. Considering on the other hand
the total change of Eq. (CC2 ) corresponding to edge (vi , vj ) ∈ E − , induced by Eq. (10), which is zero, yields
in an increase of the objective of the master problem by −φvi vj (1 − xn
vi vj ), while the objective of subproblem
s decreases by −φvi vj (1 − xsvi vj ). This shows that the objective of Eq. (CC2 ) is minimized for x∗ .

Generating Feasible Integer Solutions Prior to Convergence

Prior to the termination of optimization, it is valuable to provide feasible integer solutions on demand. This is so
that a practitioner can terminate optimization, when the gap between the objectives of the integral solution and
the relaxation is small. In this section we consider the production of feasible integer solutions, given the current
solution x∗ to the master problem, which may neither obey cycle inequalities or be integral. We refer to this
procedure as rounding.
Rounding is a coordinate descent approach defined on the graph G and its edges E with weights κ, determined
using x∗ below.

by iterating over s ∈ S, producing component partitions as in Eq. (13). We alter κ by allowing for the cutting of
edges previously cut with cost zero. We formally describe this serial rounding procedure below in Alg. 2.

Abstract
We tackle the problem of graph partitioning for image segmentation using correlation clustering (CC), which we treat as an integer linear program (ILP). We
reformulate optimization in the ILP so as to admit efficient optimization via Benders decomposition, a classic technique from operations research. Our Benders
decomposition formulation has many subproblems, each associated with a node in
the CC instance’s graph, which can be solved in parallel. Each Benders subproblem
enforces the cycle inequalities corresponding to edges with negative (repulsive)
weights attached to its corresponding node in the CC instance. We generate
Magnanti-Wong Benders rows in addition to standard Benders rows to accelerate
optimization. Our Benders decomposition approach provides a promising new
avenue to accelerate optimization for CC, and, in contrast to previous cutting plane
approaches, theoretically allows for massive parallelization.

Introduction

Many computer vision tasks involve partitioning (clustering) a set of observations into unique entities.
A powerful formulation for such tasks is that of (weighted) correlation clustering (CC). CC is defined
on a sparse graph with real valued edge weights, where nodes correspond to observations and
weighted edges describe the affinity between pairs of nodes.
For example, in image segmentation (on superpixel graphs), nodes correspond to superpixels and
edges indicate adjacency between superpixels. The weight of the edge between a pair of superpixels
relates to the probability, as defined by a classifier, that the two superpixels belong to the same ground
truth entity. This weight is positive, if the probability is greater than 12 and negative if it is less than 12 .
The magnitude of the weight is a function of the confidence of the classifier.
The CC cost function sums up the weights of the edges separating connected components (referred
to as entities) in a proposed partitioning of the graph. Optimization in CC partitions the graph into
entities so as to minimize the CC cost. CC is appealing, since the optimal number of entities emerges
naturally as a function of the edge weights, rather than requiring an additional search over some
model order parameter describing the number of clusters (entities) [37].
Optimization in CC is NP-hard for general graphs [5]. Previous methods for the optimization of CC
problems such as described in Andres et al. [1, 2] and Nowozin and Jegelka [25] are based on linear
programming with cutting planes. They do not scale easily to large CC problem instances and are not
Preprint. Under review.

easily parallelizable. The goal of this paper is to introduce an efficient mechanism for optimization in
CC for domains, where massively parallel computation could be employed.
In this paper we apply the classic Benders decomposition from operations research [10] to CC for
computer vision. Benders decomposition is commonly applied in operations research to solve mixed
integer linear programs (MILP) that have a special but common block structure. Benders decomposition partitions the variables in the MILP between a master problem and a set of subproblems. The
block structure requires that no row of the constraint matrix of the MILP contains variables from
more than one subproblem. Variables explicitly enforced to be integral lie only in the master problem.
Optimization in Benders decomposition is achieved using a cutting plane algorithm. Optimization
proceeds with the master problem solving optimization over its variables. The subsequent solution
of the subproblems can be done in parallel and provides primal/dual solutions over their variables
conditioned on the solution to the master problem. The dual solutions to the subproblems provide
constraints to the master problem. Optimization continues until no further constraints are added to
the master problem.
Benders decomposition is an exact MILP programming solver, but can be intuitively understood as
a coordinate descent procedure, iterating between the master problem and the subproblems. Here,
solving the subproblems not only provides a solution for their variables, but also a lower bound in the
form of a hyper-plane over the master problem’s variables. This lower bound is tight at the current
solution to the master problem.
Benders decomposition is accelerated using the seminal operations research technique of MagnantiWong Benders rows (MWR) [23]. MWR are generated by solving the Benders subproblems with an
alternative (often random) objective under the hard constraint of optimality (possibly within a factor)
regarding the original objective of the subproblem.
Our contribution is the use of Benders decomposition with MWR to tackle optimization in CC. This
allows for massive parallelization, in contrast to classic approaches to CC such as in Andres et al. [1].

Related Work

Correlation clustering has been successfully applied to multiple problems in computer vision including
image segmentation, multi-object tracking, instance segmentation and multi-person pose estimation.
The classical work of Andres et al. [1] models image segmentation as CC, where nodes correspond to
superpixels. Andres et al. [1] optimize CC using an integer linear programming (ILP) branch-and-cut
strategy which precludes parallel execution. Kim et al. [21] extend CC to include higher-order cost
terms over sets of nodes, which they solve using an approach similar to [1]. A parallel optimization
scheme for complete, unweighted graphs has been proposed by Pan et al. [26]. This approach relies
on random sampling and only provides optimality bounds.
Yarkony et al. [37] tackle CC in the planar graph structured problems commonly found in computer
vision. They introduce a column generation [16, 6] approach, where the pricing problem corresponds
to finding the lowest reduced cost 2-colorable partition of the graph, via a reduction to minimum cost
perfect matching [13, 29, 22]. This approach has been extended to hierarchical image segmentation
in Yarkony and Fowlkes [35] and to specific cases of non-planar graphs in Yarkony [34], Zhang et al.
[39], Andres et al. [3].
Large CC problem instances such as defined in Keuper et al. [20, 19] and Beier et al. [9] are usually
addressed by primal feasible heuristics [7, 8, 18, 20, 30]. Such approaches are highly relevant in
practice whenever the optimal solution is out of reach, but they do not provide any guarantees on the
quality of the solution.
Tang et al. [31] tackles multi-object tracking using a formulation closely related to CC, where nodes
correspond to detections of objects and edges are associated with probabilities of co-association.The
work of Insafutdinov et al. [17] and Pishchulin et al. [27] build on Tang et al. [31] in order to formulate
multi-person pose estimation using CC augmented with node labeling.
Our work is derived from the classical work in operations research on Benders decomposition [10, 11,
15]. Specifically, we are inspired by the fixed charge formulations of Cordeau et al. [12], which solves
a mixed integer linear program over a set of fixed charge variables (opening links) and a larger set of
fractional variables (flows of commodities from facilities to customers in a network) associated with
2

constraints. Benders decomposition reformulates optimization so as to use only the integer variables
and converts the fractional variables into constraints. These constraints are referred to as Benders
rows. Optimization is then tackled using a cutting plane approach. Optimization is accelerated by the
use of MWR [23], which are more binding than the standard Benders rows.
Benders decomposition has recently been introduced to computer vision (though not for CC), for the
purpose of multi-person pose estimation [32, 33, 36]. In these works, multi-person pose estimation is
modeled so as to admit efficient optimization, using column generation and Benders decomposition
jointly. The application of Benders decomposition in our paper is distinct regarding the problem
domain, the underlying integer program and the structure of the Benders subproblems.

Standard Correlation Clustering Formulation

In this section, we review the standard optimization formulation for CC [1], which corresponds to a
graph partitioning problem w.r.t. the graph G = (V, E). This problem is defined by the following
binary edge labeling problem.
Definition 1. Given a graph G = (V, E) with nodes v ∈ V and undirected edges (vi , vj ) ∈ E. A
label xvi vj ∈ {0, 1} indicates with xvi vj = 1 that the nodes vi , vj are in separate components and is
zero otherwise. Given the edge weight φvi vj ∈ R, the binary edge labeling problem is to find an edge
label x = (xvi vj ) ∈ {0, 1}|E| , for which the total weight of the cut edges is minimized:

where E − , E + denote the subsets of E, for which the weight φvi vj is negative and non-negative,
respectively, C is the set of undirected cycles in E containing exactly one member of E − , (vic , vjc ) is
the edge in E − associated with cycle c and Ec+ ⊆ E + associated with cycle c.
Note that the graph G defined by E is very sparse for real problems [37]. Also we refer to an edge
(vi , vj ) with xvi vj = 1 as a cut edge.
The objective in Eq. (CC1 ) is to minimize the total weight of the cut edges. The constraints in Eq. (1)
ensure that, within every cycle of G, the number of cut edges can not be exactly one. This enforces
the labeling x to decompose G such that cut edges are exactly those edges that straddle distinct
components. We refer to the constraints in Eq. (1) as cycle inequalities.
Solving Eq. (CC1 ) is intractable due to the large number of cycle inequalities. Andres et al. [1]
generates solutions by alternating between solving the ILP over a nascent set of constraints Cˆ
(initialized empty) and adding new constraints from the set of currently violated cycle inequalities.
Generating constraints corresponds to iterating over (vi , vj ) ∈ E − and identifying the shortest
path between the nodes vi , vj in the graph with edges E \ (vi , vj ) and weights equal to x. If the

corresponding path has total weight less than xvi vj , the corresponding constraint is added to C.
LP relaxation of Eq. (CC1 )-(1) can be solved instead of the ILP in each iteration until no violated
cycle inequalities exist, after which the ILP must be solved in each iteration.
We should note that earlier work in CC for computer vision did not require that cycle inequalities
contain exactly one member of E − , which is on the right hand side of Eq. (1). It is established with
Lemma(1) in Yarkony et al. [38], that the addition of cycle inequalities, that contain edges in E − , E +
on the left hand side, right hand side of Eq. (1), respectively, do not tighten the ILP in Eq. (CC1 )-(1)
or its LP relaxation.
In this section, we reviewed the baseline approach for solving CC in the computer vision community.
In the subsequent sections, we rely on the characterization of CC in Eq. (CC1 )-(1), though not on the
specific solver of Andres et al. [1].

Benders Decomposition for Correlation Clustering

In this section, we introduce a novel approach to CC using Benders decomposition (referred to as
BDCC). Our proposed decomposition is defined by a minimal vertex cover on E − with members
S ⊂ V indexed by vs . Each s ∈ S is associated with a Benders subproblem and vs is referred to as
the root of that Benders subproblem. Edges in E − are partitioned arbitrarily between the subproblems,
such that each (vi , vj ) ∈ E − is associated with either the subproblem with root vi or the subproblem
with root vj . Here, Es− is the subset of E − associated with subproblem s. The subproblem with root
vs enforces the cycle inequalities Cs , where Cs is the subset of C containing edges in Es− . We use Es+
to denote the subset of E + adjacent to vs .
In this section, we assume that we are provided with S, which can be produced greedily or using an
LP/ILP solver.
Below, we rewrite Eq. (CC1 ) using an auxiliary function Q(φ, s, x). Here Q(φ, s, x) provides the
cost to alter x to satisfy all cycle inequalities in Cs , by increasing/decreasing xvi vj for (vi , vj ) in
E + /Es− , respectively. Below we describe the changes of the master’s problem edge labeling x, which
is based on the edge labeling of each Benders subproblem xs = (xsvi vj ) ∈ {0, 1}|s| , where |s| is the
number of edges in the subproblem s.

We now construct a solution x∗ = {x∗vi vj , (xs∗
vi vj )s∈S } for which Eq. (CC2 ) is minimized and all
cycle inequalities are satisfied. We start from a given solution x = {xvi vj , (xsvi vj )s∈S } and proceed
as follows.

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E + .

(3)
(4)

The right hand side of Eq. (4) cannot exceed 1 at optimality because of the constraint in Eq. (2).
Given the solution x∗vi vj , the optimizing solution to each Benders subproblem s is denoted xs∗
vi vj and
is defined as follows.

1, if (vi , vj ) ∈ Es−
xs∗
=
(5)
vi vj
0, otherwise.
In Sec. A in the supplement, we show that the cost of {x∗vi vj , (xs∗
vi vj )s∈S } is no greater than that of
{xvi vj , (xsvi vj )s∈S }, with regard to the objective in Eq. (CC2 ) and that Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0 holds for all
s ∈ S.
It follows that there always exists an optimizing solution x to Eq. (CC2 ) such that Q(φ, s, x) = 0 for
all s ∈ S.
Observe, that there exists an optimal partition xs of the nodes of the graph , in Eq. (2), which is
2-colorable. This is because any partition xs can be altered without increasing its cost, by merging
connected components that are adjacent to one another, not including the root node vs . Note, that
merging any pair of such components, does not increase the cost, since those components are not
separated by negative weight edges in subproblem s and so the result is still a partition.
Given this observation, we rewrite the optimization Eq. (CC2 ) regarding Q(φ, s, x), using the node
labeling formulation of min-cut, with the notation below.
4

We indicate with mv = 1 that node v ∈ V is not in the component associated with the root of
subproblem s and mv = 0 otherwise. To avoid extra notation mvs is replaced by 0. Let
(
1, for (vi , vj ) ∈ E + , if (vi , vj ) is cut in xs , but is not cut in x
s
f vi vj =
(6)
1, for (vi , vj ) ∈ Es− , if (vi , vj ) is not cut in xs , but is cut in x.
Thus, the definition for the first/second case implies a penalty of φvi vj / - φvi vj , which is added to
Q(φ, s, x). Note moreover that xsvi vj = fvsi vj for all (vi , vj ) ∈ E + and that xsvi vj = 1 − fvsi vj for all
(vi , vj ) ∈ Es− .
Below we write Q(φ, s, x) as primal/dual LP, with primal constraints associated with dual variables
ψ, λ, which are noted in the primal. Given binary x, we need only enforce that f, m are non-negative
to ensure that there exists an optimizing solution for f, m which is binary. This is a consequence of
the optimization being totally unimodular, given that x is binary. Total unimodularity is a known
property of the min-cut/max flow LP [14]. The primal subproblem is therefore given by the following.

In Eq. (8) and subsequently 1Λ (x) denotes the binary indicator function for some set Λ, which returns

any dual feasible solution for the dual problem (8) describes an affine function of x, which is a tight
lower bound on Q(φ, s, x). We compact the terms λ, ψ into ω z , where ωvzi vj is associated with the

Cutting Plane Optimization

Optimization in Eq. (CC3 ) is intractable since |Z| equals the number of dual feasible solutions across
subproblems, which is infinite. Since we cannot consider the entire set Z, we use a cutting plane
approach to construct a set Ẑ ⊂ Z, that is sufficient to solve Eq. (CC3 ) exactly. We initialize Ẑ as
the empty set. We iterate between solving the LP relaxation of Eq. (CC3 ) over Ẑ (referred to as the
master problem) and generating new Benders rows until no violated constraints exist.
This ensures that no violated cycle inequalities exist but may not ensure that x is integral. To enforce
integrality, we iterate between solving the ILP in Eq. (CC3 ) over Ẑ and adding Benders rows to Ẑ.
By solving the LP relaxation first, we avoid unnecessary and expensive calls to the ILP solver.
To generate Benders rows given x, we iterate over S and generate one Benders row using Eq. (8), if s
is associated with a violated cycle inequality, which we determine as follows. Given s, x we iterate
over (vi , vj ) ∈ Es− . We find the shortest path from vi to vj on graph G with edges E, with weights
equal to the vector x. If the length of this path, denoted as d(vi , vj ), is strictly less than xvi vj , then
we have identified a violated cycle inequality associated with s.
We describe our cutting plane approach in Alg. 1, with line by line description in Sec. B in the
supplementary material. To accelerate optimization, we add MWR in addition to standard Benders
rows, which we describe in the following Sec. 5.
Prior to termination of Alg. 1, one can produce a feasible integer solution x∗ from any solution x,
1
provided by the master problem, as follows. First, for each (vi , vj ) ∈ E, set x∗∗
vi vj = 1, if xvi vj > 2
∗
and otherwise set x∗∗
vi vj = 0. Second, for each (vi , vj ) ∈ E, set xvi vj = 1, if vi , vj are in separate
∗∗
connected components of the solution described by x and otherwise set x∗vi vj = 0. The cost of the
feasible integer solution x∗ provides an upper bound on the cost of the optimal solution. In Sec. C
(supplementary material), we provide a more involved approach to produce feasible integer solutions.
In this section, we characterized CC using Benders decomposition and provided a cutting plane
algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization.

Magnanti-Wong Benders Rows

We accelerate Benders decomposition (see Sec. 4) using the classic operations research technique of
Magnanti-Wong Benders Rows (MWR) [23]. The Benders row, given in Eq. (8), provides a tight
bound at x∗ , where x∗ is the master problem solution used to generate the Benders row. However,
ideally, we want our Benders row to provide good lower bounds for a large set of x different from x∗ ,
6

Figure 1: Left: We plot the gap between the upper and lower bounds as a function of time for various
values of τ on selected problem instances. We use red,green,blue for τ = [0.5, 0.99, .01] respectively,
and black for not using Magnanti-Wong rows. We show both the computation time with and without
exploiting parallelization of subproblems with dotted and solid lines, respectively. We use titles to
indicate the approximate difficulty of the problem as ranked by input file size of 100 files.
Right: We compare the benefits of parallelization and MWR across our data set. We scatter plot the
total running time versus the total running time when solving each subproblem is done on its own
CPU across problem instances. We use red to indicate τ = 0.5 and black to indicate that MWR are
not used. We draw a line with slope=1 in magenta to better enable appreciation of the red and black
points. NOTE: The time spent generating Benders rows, in a given iteration of BDCC when using
parallel processing, is the maximum time spent to solve any sub-problem for that iteration.
while being tight (or perhaps very active) at x∗ . To achieve this, we use a modified version of Eq. (8),
where we replace the objective and add one additional constraint.
We follow the tradition of the operations research literature and use a random negative valued vector
(with unit norm) in place of the objective Eq. (8). This random vector is unique each time a Benders
−1
subproblem is solved. We experimented with using as an objective .0001+|φ
, which encourages
vi vj |
the cutting of edges with large positive weight, but it works as well as the random negative objective.
Here .0001 is a tiny positive number. It prevents the terms in the objective from becoming infinite.
Below, we enforce the new Benders row to be active at x∗ , by requiring that the dual cost is within a
tolerance τ ∈ (0, 1) of the optimum w.r.t. the objective in Eq. (8).

Here, τ = 1 requires optimality w.r.t. the objective in Eq. (8), while τ = 0 ignores optimality. In our
experiments, we found that τ = 12 provides strong performance.

Experiments: Image Segmentation

In this section, we demonstrate the value of our algorithm BDCC on CC problem instances for image
segmentation on the benchmark Berkeley Segmentation Data Set (BSDS) [24]. Our experiments
demonstrate the following three findings. (1) BDCC solves CC instances for image segmentation; (2) BDCC successfully exploits parallelization; (3) the use of MWR dramatically accelerates
optimization.
To benchmark performance, we employ cost terms provided by the OPENGM2 dataset [4] for BSDS.
This allows for a direct comparison of our results to the ones from Andres et al. [1]. We use the
random unit norm negative valued objective when generating MWR. We use CPLEX to solve all
linear and integer linear programming problems considered during the course of optimization. We use
a maximum total CPU time of 600 seconds, for each problem instance (regardless of parallelization).

within a certain amount of time (10,50,100,300) seconds, with and without MWR/parallelization.

MWR are generated.

We formulate the selection of S, as a minimum vertex cover problem, where for every edge (vi , vj ) ∈
E − , at least one of vi , vj is in S. We solve for the minimum vertex cover exactly as an ILP. Given S,
we assign edges in E − to a connected selected node in S arbitrarily. We found experimentally that
solving for the minimum vertex cover consumed negligible CPU time for our dataset. We attribute
this fact to the structure of our problem domain, since the minimum vertex cover is an NP-hard
problem. For problem instances where solving for the minimum vertex cover exactly is difficult, the
minimum vertex cover problem can be solved approximately or greedily.
In Fig. 1 (left) we demonstrate the effectiveness of BDCC with various τ for different problem
difficulties. We observe that the presence of MWR dramatically accelerates optimization. However,
the exact value of τ does not effect the speed of optimization dramatically. We show performance
with and without relying on parallel processing. Our parallel processing times assume that we
have one CPU for each subproblem. For the problem instances in our application the number of
subproblems is under one thousand, each of which are very easy to solve. The parallel and nonparallel time comparisons share only the time to solve the master problem. We observe large benefits
of parallelization for all settings of τ . However, when MWR are not used, we observe diminished
improvement, since the master problem consumes a larger proportion of total CPU time.
In Fig. 1(right), we demonstrate the speed up induced by the use of parallelization. For most problem
instances, the total CPU time required when using no MWR was prohibitively large, which is not the
case when MWR are employed. Thus most problem instances solved without MWR terminated early.
In Tab. 1, we consider the convergence of the bounds for τ = {0, 12 }; ( τ = 0 means that no MWR
are generated). We consider a set of tolerances on convergence regarding the duality gap, which is
the difference between the anytime solution (upper bound) and the lower bound on the objective. For
each such tolerance , we compute the percentage of instances, for which the duality gap is less than
, after various amounts of time. We observe that the performance of optimization without MWR,
but exploiting parallelization performs worse than using MWR, but without paralleliziation. This
demonstrates that, across the dataset, MWR are of greater importance than parallelization.

APPENDIX: Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0 at Optimality

In this section, we demonstrate that there exists an x∗ , that minimizes Eq. (CC2 ), for which Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0.
Given an arbitrary solution {xvi vj , (xsvi vj )s∈S } another solution {x∗vi vj , (xs∗
vi vj )s∈S } is constructed, for which
Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0 holds, without increasing the objective in Eq. (CC2 ). We write the updates below in terms of
xs .
M

x∗vi vj = xvi vj + max xsvi vj
s∈S

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E +

M

x∗vi vj = xvi vj + xsvi vj − 1 ∀(vi , vj ) ∈ Es− , s ∈ S
M

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E +

M

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ Es− , s ∈ S.

vi vj = 0
xs∗
vi vj = 1

(10)

The updates in Eq. (10) are equivalent to the following updates using f s ,f s∗ . Here f s , f s∗ correspond to the
optimizing solution for f in subproblem s, given x, x∗ respectively.
x∗vi vj = xvi vj + max fvsi vj
s∈S

x∗vi vj = xvi vj − fvsi vj

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E +

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ Es− , s ∈ S

fvs∗
= 0 ∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E +
i vj

(11)

fvs∗
= 0 ∀(vi , vj ) ∈ Es−
i vj
These updates in Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) preserve the feasibility of the primal LP in Eq. (7). Also notice, that
since f s∗ is a zero valued vector for all s ∈ S, then Q(φ, s, x∗ ) = 0 for all s ∈ S.
We now consider, the total change in Eq. (CC2 ) corresponding to edge (vi , vj ) ∈ E + , induced by Eq. (10),
which is non-positive. The objective of the master problem increases by φvi vj maxs∈S xsvi vj , while the total
P
decrease in the objectives of the subproblems is φvi vj s∈S xsvi vj . Since the latter value is greater than the
former value, the total change in problem (CC2 ) decreases more than it increases. Considering on the other hand
the total change of Eq. (CC2 ) corresponding to edge (vi , vj ) ∈ E − , induced by Eq. (10), which is zero, yields
in an increase of the objective of the master problem by −φvi vj (1 − xn
vi vj ), while the objective of subproblem
s decreases by −φvi vj (1 − xsvi vj ). This shows that the objective of Eq. (CC2 ) is minimized for x∗ .

Line by Line Description of BDCC

We provide the line by line description of Alg. 1.
• Line 1: Initialize the nascent set of Benders rows Ẑ to the empty set.
• Line 2: Indicate that we have not solved the LP relaxation yet.
• Line 3-17: Alternate between solving the master problem and generating Benders rows, until a feasible
integral solution is produced.
1. Line 4: Solve the master problem providing a solution x, which may not satisfy all cycle
inequalities. We enforce integrality if we have finished solving the LP relaxation, which is
indicated by done_lp=True.
2. Line 5: Indicate that we have not yet added any Benders rows to this iteration.
3. Line 6-13: Add Benders rows by iterating over subproblems and adding Benders rows corresponding to subproblems, associated with violated cycle inequalities.
– Line 7: Check if there exists a violated cycle inequality associated with Es− . This is done
by iterating over (vi , vj ) ∈ Es− and checking if the shortest path from vi to vj is less than
xvi vj . This distance is defined on the graph’s edges E with weights equal to x.
– Lines 8-10: Generate Benders rows associated with subproblem s and add them to nascent
set Ẑ.
– Line 11: Indicate that a Benders row was added this iteration.
4. Lines 14-16: If no Benders rows were added to this iteration, we enforce integrality on x, when
solving the master problem for the remainder of the algorithm.

Generating Feasible Integer Solutions Prior to Convergence

Prior to the termination of optimization, it is valuable to provide feasible integer solutions on demand. This is so
that a practitioner can terminate optimization, when the gap between the objectives of the integral solution and
the relaxation is small. In this section we consider the production of feasible integer solutions, given the current
solution x∗ to the master problem, which may neither obey cycle inequalities or be integral. We refer to this
procedure as rounding.
Rounding is a coordinate descent approach defined on the graph G and its edges E with weights κ, determined
using x∗ below.
κvi vj = φvi vj (1 − x∗vi vj ) ∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E +
κvi vj =

φvi vj x∗vi vj

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ E

∗

Consider that x is integral and feasible (where feasibility indicates that x∗ satisfies all cycle inequalities). Let
xs∗ define the boundaries in partition x∗ , of the connected component containing s. Here xs∗
vi vj = 1 if exactly
one of vi , vj is in the connected component containing s under cut x∗ . Observe, that Q(κ, s, x0s ) = 0, where
s∗
x0s
as the solution to Eq. (7). Thus xs∗ is the minimizer of Eq. (7).
vi vj = 1Es− (vi , vj ), is achieved using x
s∗
The union of the edges cut in x across s ∈ S is identical to x∗ . Note that when x∗ is integral and feasible
then the solution produced below has cost equal to that of x∗ .

∀(vi , vj ) ∈ Es− , s ∈ S

The procedure of Eq. (13) can be used regardless of whether x∗ is integral or feasible. Note that if x∗ is close to
integral and close to feasible, then Eq. (13) is biased to produce a solution that is similar to x∗ by design of κ.
We now consider a serial version of Eq. (13), which may provide improved results. We construct a partition x+
by iterating over s ∈ S, producing component partitions as in Eq. (13). We alter κ by allowing for the cutting of
edges previously cut with cost zero. We formally describe this serial rounding procedure below in Alg. 2.

When solving for the fast minimizer of Q(κ, s, x0n ), we rely on the network flow solver of Rother et al. [28],
though we do not exploit its capacity to tackle non-submodular problems.
